## 23. Enter and exit transitions from `display: none`

Use it for dialogs, popovers and anything else toggled with `display`. It replaces a script that adds classes and waits for `transitionend`.

```css
dialog,
[popover] {
  opacity: 0;
  transition:
    opacity 0.2s var(--ease-out, ease-out),
    translate 0.2s var(--ease-out, ease-out),
    display 0.2s allow-discrete,
    overlay 0.2s allow-discrete;
}

dialog::backdrop {
  opacity: 0;
  transition:
    opacity 0.2s var(--ease-out, ease-out),
    display 0.2s allow-discrete,
    overlay 0.2s allow-discrete;
}

dialog[open],
dialog[open]::backdrop { opacity: 1; }

[popover]:popover-open { opacity: 1; }

@starting-style {
  dialog[open],
  [popover]:popover-open,
  dialog[open]::backdrop { opacity: 0; }
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  dialog,
  [popover] { translate: 0 0.5rem; }

  dialog[open] { translate: 0 0; }

  [popover]:popover-open { translate: 0 0; }

  @starting-style {
    dialog[open],
    [popover]:popover-open { translate: 0 0.5rem; }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- Put `@starting-style` after the open-state rule. It has no extra weight in the cascade.
- Never start from `scale(0)`. If the element scales in, start at `scale(0.95)` with `opacity: 0`.
- The dialog's `::backdrop` needs the same three states and its own transition, as in the block. Without them it snaps while the dialog fades.
- Write no fallback. Where the exit is not supported the element closes at once.
- Keep `[popover]:popover-open` out of the selector list that opens the dialog. A browser that does not know one selector in a list drops the whole rule, and the dialog would open at `opacity: 0`. Inside `@starting-style` the shared list is safe, because every browser that reads the block knows the selector.

Support: both directions in Chrome 117. In Safari 27 the entry animates and `<dialog>` and popovers close at once, tested in real Safari on 2026-10-01. An element toggled with a class animates both ways there. Firefox 129 animates the entry only.

## 26. Popover anchored to its trigger

Use it for dropdown menus and other popovers opened by a click. It replaces a positioning library or a script that reads `getBoundingClientRect()`.

```html
<button popovertarget="menu">Options</button>
<div id="menu" popover>
  <button>Rename</button>
  <button>Delete</button>
</div>
```

```css
@supports (position-area: block-end) {
  [popover] {
    margin: 0;
    margin-block-start: 0.5rem;
    position-area: block-end span-inline-end;
    position-try-fallbacks: flip-block, flip-inline, flip-block flip-inline;
  }
}
```

Rules:

- Use `span-*` values, not `center`. Adam Argyle found that `center` stops the flips when the popover is wider than its grid cell.
- `margin-block-start` is the gap between trigger and popover. The flip mirrors it, so the gap stays on the trigger's side.
- A popover opened by a script has no anchor and lands in the top-left corner. Pass the trigger, as in `menu.showPopover({ source: button })`.
- Write no fallback. Without support the `@supports` block is skipped and the popover opens centered in the viewport.

Support: Chrome 133, Firefox 147, Safari 26.

## 39. Reveal with `clip-path`

Use it for dropdowns, menus and panels that open over the page and whose height is not known. It unrolls the panel without animating `height`, and it works in every browser.

```css
.menu {
  clip-path: inset(0 -3rem 100%);
  visibility: hidden;
}

.menu.is-open {
  clip-path: inset(0 -3rem -3rem);
  visibility: visible;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .menu {
    transition:
      clip-path 0.25s var(--ease-out, ease-out),
      visibility 0.25s;
  }
}
```

Rules:

- The negative inset must be larger than the shadow's blur plus its offset.
- Use it for panels that overlap the page. A closed panel in the normal flow leaves a gap, so an accordion uses entry 4.
- Add `round` with a radius inside `inset()` only when the clip itself should have round corners. The element's own `border-radius` still applies.

Support: every browser.

## 4. Accordion that animates its height

Use it for FAQs and any other disclosure. `<details>` already gives you the toggle, keyboard support and find-in-page. These rules animate the open and the close with no JavaScript.

```css
:root { interpolate-size: allow-keywords; }

details::details-content {
  height: 0;
  overflow: clip;
}

details[open]::details-content { height: auto; }

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  details::details-content {
    transition:
      height 0.3s var(--ease-out, ease-out),
      content-visibility 0.3s allow-discrete;
  }
}
```

Rules:

- Put padding on an element inside, never on `::details-content`. Padding there stays visible when the accordion is closed.
- Give sibling `<details>` the same `name` attribute to keep one open at a time.
- Hide the marker with `summary { list-style: none; }` plus `summary::-webkit-details-marker { display: none; }` for Safari.
- Write no fallback. Safari and Firefox do not support `interpolate-size` yet, so they open and close without the animation.

Support: `::details-content` in Chrome 131, Safari 18.4, Firefox 143. `interpolate-size` in Chrome 129 only.

## 35. Indicator that slides to the active item

Use it for the underline on a tab row or the bar beside a side nav. It replaces a script that measures the active item and writes a `transform` and a width.

```html
<nav class="tabs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/overview" aria-current="page">Overview</a></li>
    <li><a href="/pricing">Pricing and billing</a></li>
    <li><a href="/docs">Docs</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

```css
.tabs { anchor-scope: --active; }

.tabs ul {
  position: relative;
  display: flex;
}

.tabs [aria-current="page"] { anchor-name: --active; }

.tabs ul::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  position-anchor: --active;
  inset-block-end: 0;
  inset-inline-start: anchor(start);
  inline-size: anchor-size(inline);
  block-size: 2px;
  background: currentColor;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .tabs ul::after {
    transition:
      inset-inline-start 0.25s var(--ease-out, ease-out),
      inline-size 0.25s var(--ease-out, ease-out);
  }
}
```

Rules:

- Keep `anchor-scope` on the component root. Without it an anchor name is global, and two navs on one page both follow the last active item.
- The list needs `position: relative`, so the bar is positioned against the box that holds the items.
- For a vertical list swap the axes. Use `inset-block-start: anchor(top)` and `block-size: anchor-size(height)`, and transition those two.
- Give the active item a second cue such as weight or color. A browser without anchor positioning drops the `anchor()` declarations and the bar has no width.

Support: Chrome 131, Firefox 147, Safari 26. Firefox places the bar and does not slide it.
